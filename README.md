ARs Attacks! is a cross-modal multiplayer game that pits secret agents against aliens and their allies. For this live, WebXR-based experience, users choose between three different play modes:

Aliens - Mobile AR - Built with ARKit / ARCore, Aliens soar above the battlefield, spitting fire and reigning destruction upon the Earth.

Secret Agents - Desktop VR - Equipped with a shield and a raygun, Secret Agents are last stand against the invading hoard.

Allies - Standard Browsers - Spectators of a live match are encouraged to choose a side by either dropping a shield around the agents or by shrouding the aliens in fog.
